# Portfolio website
Personal portfolio built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and 
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), using [Dato](https://www.datocms.com/) as a CMS. 
The site is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Currently, it is only a placeholder while I finish writing the content.
